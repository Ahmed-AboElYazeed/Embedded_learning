# üëÅÔ∏è Blind Spot Detection System (BSD)

This project demonstrates a **low-cost Blind Spot Detection (BSD) system** for vehicles using **Arduino-based sensors** and logic. The system was designed, tested, and validated both in hardware (real-world prototyping) and virtually using **Proteus simulation**.

> ‚úÖ Both the **Arduino sketch** and **Proteus project file** are included for reproduction and experimentation.

## üß† Project Concept

Blind spot detection is a key driver-assistance system that alerts the driver to obstacles in blind zones. This project implements a basic dual-side BSD prototype that detects objects using ultrasonic sensors and notifies the driver using LEDs and optional buzzer output.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Arduino UNO**
- **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors** for bench testing only
- **LED indicators**
- **Proteus 8.0+** for simulation
- **Simple timing and distance calculation logic**

## üìÅ Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `BSD_AZ_2sides_s_Final_s.ino` | Arduino sketch implementing BSD logic |
| `E-RALLY_EVER_blindSpotDetectionSys_2sides_Final.pdsprj` | Proteus simulation project file |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Two ultrasonic sensors** are placed on both sides of the simulated vehicle.
- The system constantly checks for obstacles in the blind spot zone (distance < threshold).
- If an object is detected on either side:
  - Corresponding **LED turns ON**.
  - Optionally, a **buzzer** can sound for critical alerts (I didn't includle it).

## üöÄ How to Run

### üëâ In Simulation:
1. Open `E-RALLY_EVER_blindSpotDetectionSys_2sides_Final.pdsprj` using Proteus 8.
2. Upload the provided `.ino` file inside Proteus via the Arduino component.
3. Start the simulation and use virtual movement blocks to simulate obstacles.

### üëâ On Real Hardware:
1. Upload `BSD_AZ_2sides_s_Final_s.ino` to an Arduino Uno board.
2. Connect two HC-SR04 sensors on each side (e.g., Left = D2‚ÄìD3, Right = D4‚ÄìD5).
3. Wire LEDs to indicate detection.
4. Power the board and test using your hand or moving object.
